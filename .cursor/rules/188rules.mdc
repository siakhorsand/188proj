# Your rule content

- Use the slimevolleygym directory as a reference, model all of your implementations loosely based on the files in this directory and follow the same practices unless told otherwise. 
- Make sure to test run all files after writing them to make sure everything works 
- find ways to directly edit ipynb since you cant edit cells. 
- your main workspace to add or manipulate files is in the SIA directory.
- feel free to copy files from slimevolleygym directory but dont change anything inside it. 
- if you are using a library that supports my macbook pro m4 pro gpu to speed up processing, make sure to enable using my macbook chip.
- make training processes well visualized using text and graphs
